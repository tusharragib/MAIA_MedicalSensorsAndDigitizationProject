# MAIA_MedicalSensorsAndDigitizationProject

This repository contains my class project, "An Image-Based Comprehensive Approach for Automatic Segmentation of Left Ventricle from Cardiac Short Axis Cine MR Images," from the first semester of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications at the University of Burgundy in France.

My colleague Ms. Marya Ryspayeva and I accomplished this project as a group activity.
